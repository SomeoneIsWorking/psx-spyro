# 0196: gameplay in-betweens judder

Status: open

## Observed
USER, 2026-10-20: "there is a ton of interpolation judder" (Spyro, fps60 on, real window).

The play checks of 2026-10-16 (0191-0193) passed the vsync and frame-order bars in gameplay, so the
judder is not a missed present or a repeated record. It is what an in-between shows: a position that
does not lie between frame n-1 and frame n for some object, or the camera and an object blended on
different terms.

## Cause
`psxport runtime/psx/present/frame_composer.cpp:composeFrame` kept an object's entries from frame n
when its in-between render sampled a CLUT frame n never sampled, and kept every unowned primitive
as frame n drew it, so one present mixed lerped and unlerped primitives.

## Change so far (B4)
`composeFrame` reads a CLUT frame n never sampled from the device VRAM, and an in-between with any
primitive no producer owns, or any render it cannot place, is not composed: frame n is shown whole.
This applies to every title with StateProducers (Crash Bash, Tomba and Toy Story 2 too).

**Regression:** this turns gameplay interpolation off rather than fixing it. Every gameplay
in-between in Spyro 1, 2 and 3 now repeats frame n, so fps60 shows 30 fps motion; Spyro 1's actors,
sky, glows and other owned objects, which used to move on in-betweens, now never do. The judder is
gone only because nothing is interpolated.

## Evidence
Spyro 1, `warp 10`, fps60, hidden window, 40 consecutive presents, mean absolute difference of
adjacent presents: before, alternating about 1.3 and 12.9 (in-betweens nearly frame n with some
objects moved); after, 0.0 and about 13 (in-betweens are frame n whole). Spyro 1/2/3 at 16:9 and
4:3 after the B4 fixes (12 presents while turning): every in-between 0.0 from its frame n. Real-time
check by the operator not done.

## Next
The fix is producers for every primitive a gameplay record holds, so an in-between can be composed
whole: Spyro 1 GamestateDraw `0x8001ED5C` callees (2986 per frame, issue 0186); Spyro 2 `0x800156FC`
and `0x80011E9C` plus span misses, Spyro 3 span misses (issue 0176). Until then also check whether
an owned object or the camera is blended on different terms, at its producer or pairing, once its
frame can be composed.
